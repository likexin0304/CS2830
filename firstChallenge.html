		<P>Third Paragraph -> this is a lot of text that we are trying to split on two separate lines, we are going to <br> 
		see if I simply add a new line or press enter, if that will separate this string on two lines in the browser. <br>
		The answer is no, you need a break to put text on two separate lines</P>
